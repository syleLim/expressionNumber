Expression of Number
===

## Explain
You are abosrbed in math study. One time you studied, you knew several ways to natural number with sucessive natural numbers. For example, 15 can express four ways.
 - 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 15
 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
 - 7 + 8 = 15
 - 15 = 15

paramters are natural number `n` and write function that return way to express natural number with sucessive nutural numbers.

### Constraint
 - `n` is natural number 10,000 or less


**Ex >** `n` = 15  : `return` 4
